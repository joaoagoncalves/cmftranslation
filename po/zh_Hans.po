"GNU was launched by Richard Stallman (rms) in 1983, as an operating system "
"which would be put together by people working together for the freedom of "
"all software users to control their computing.  rms remains the Chief "

"The primary and continuing goal of GNU is to offer a Unix-compatible system "
"that would be 100% <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free software</a>.  "
"Not 95% free, not 99.5%, but 100%.  The name of the system, GNU, is a "
"recursive acronym meaning GNU's Not Unix&mdash;a way of paying tribute to "
"the technical ideas of Unix, while at the same time saying that GNU is "
"something different.  Technically, GNU is like Unix.  But unlike Unix, GNU "
"gives its users freedom."

"href=\"/software/software.html\">GNU packages</a> have been designed to work "
"together so we could have a functioning GNU system.  It has turned out that "
"they also serve as a common &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; for many distros, so "
"contributions to GNU packages help the free software community as a whole.  "
"Naturally, work on GNU is ongoing, with the goal to create a system that "
"gives the greatest freedom to computer users.  GNU packages include "
"user-oriented applications, utilities, tools, libraries, even "
"games&mdash;all the programs that an operating system can usefully offer to "
"its users.  <a href=\"/help/evaluation.html\">New packages are welcome.</a>"

"organization also founded by rms to advocate free software ideals.  Among "
"other things, the FSF accepts copyright assignments and disclaimers, so it "

"program to GNU does <em>not</em> require transferring copyright to the FSF.  "
"If you do assign copyright, the FSF will enforce the GPL for the program if "
